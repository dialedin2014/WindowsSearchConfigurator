# Specification Quality Checklist: Windows Search Index Rules Manager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 22, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification is written from user perspective without implementation details. While the user request mentions "C# console application," the spec correctly focuses on WHAT the system does (managing Windows Search index rules) rather than HOW it's implemented. Technical references (registry, WMI, COM) are appropriately placed in Assumptions and Dependencies sections, not in requirements.

✅ **PASS** - All content focuses on business value: system administrators managing search index rules for security, performance, and organizational needs.

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Technical terms (UNC paths, wildcards) are used appropriately where domain knowledge is expected.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are specific and complete.

✅ **PASS** - All 20 functional requirements are testable:
- FR-001: Testable by viewing rules and verifying display
- FR-002-003: Testable by adding/removing folders and verifying changes
- FR-004: Testable by providing invalid paths and verifying validation
- FR-005: Testable by running without admin privileges
- FR-006-007: Testable by triggering destructive operations and errors
- FR-008-020: Each has clear, verifiable criteria

✅ **PASS** - All 10 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics:
- SC-001: 5 seconds (time-based)
- SC-002: 3 or fewer inputs (count-based)
- SC-003: 95% success rate (percentage-based)
- SC-004-010: All include quantifiable targets

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
- Focus on user outcomes ("Users can view", "Users can add")
- No mention of specific frameworks, languages, or implementation details
- Metrics based on user experience, not system internals

✅ **PASS** - All 5 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format covering normal and error conditions.

✅ **PASS** - 9 edge cases identified covering service status, path handling, network issues, permissions, conflicts, corruption, disk space, path limits, and concurrency.

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded with comprehensive "Out of Scope" section listing 10 items explicitly excluded (GUI, direct database manipulation, scheduling, etc.).

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies section lists 4 clear dependencies; Assumptions section lists 10 reasonable assumptions documented.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement is testable through the acceptance scenarios defined in user stories. Requirements align with user scenarios.

✅ **PASS** - 5 prioritized user stories cover all primary flows:
- P1: View (read-only audit)
- P2: Add (primary modification)
- P3: Remove (complementary modification)
- P4: Modify (convenience feature)
- P5: Batch operations (advanced/enterprise)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria directly map to feature capabilities with measurable targets for performance, usability, reliability, and completeness.

✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains focus on WHAT and WHY throughout. Implementation details are appropriately isolated to Assumptions and Dependencies sections as context, not requirements.

## Notes

**Specification Quality**: EXCELLENT - All checklist items pass on first validation.

**Strengths**:
1. Well-prioritized user stories following MVP principles (P1 is independently valuable)
2. Comprehensive edge case identification
3. Clear scope boundaries with detailed out-of-scope section
4. Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
5. All requirements testable and unambiguous
6. Good balance between detail and abstraction

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES - Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

No updates required. This specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for planning.
