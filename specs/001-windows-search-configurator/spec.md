# Feature Specification: Windows Search Configurator

**Feature Branch**: `001-windows-search-configurator`  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a C# console application for managing Windows Search index rules"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: When the specification mentions exporting/importing rules via configuration file (FR-011, FR-012, User Story 5), which file format should be used? → A: JSON
- Q: Where should audit logs be written (FR-015 mentions logging all modification operations)? → A: Text file in application directory or user profile
- Q: Should the application require confirmation prompts for all operations or only destructive ones? → A: Only destructive operations (remove, modify existing rules) require confirmation by default; configurable via command-line flag
- Q: When adding a folder to the index, should it include subfolders by default? → A: Recursive by default, with flag to make it non-recursive, and support for file type filters
- Q: What can filters specify when indexing a folder? → A: Filters can specify patterns to identify files, file extensions, and subfolders to exclude from the index
- Q: Should the application require administrative privileges for all operations or only for modifications? → A: Standard user can view; admin required only for modifications
- Q: Can users search for file extensions and configure their indexing settings? → A: Yes, users can perform wildcard searches for file extensions and configure indexing depth (File Properties only vs File Properties and Contents)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Current Index Rules (Priority: P1)

System administrators need to view which folders and file types are currently included or excluded from the Windows Search index to understand the current configuration state before making changes.

**Why this priority**: This is foundational - users must see what exists before they can modify it. This provides immediate value as a read-only audit tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application and viewing the current index rules. Delivers value as an audit/inspection tool even without modification capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Windows Search service is running, **When** user launches the application with a "list" or "view" command, **Then** system displays all currently indexed locations with their inclusion/exclusion status
2. **Given** user requests to view index rules, **When** the system retrieves rules, **Then** rules are displayed in a readable format showing folder paths, file type filters, and rule types (include/exclude)
3. **Given** no index rules are configured, **When** user views rules, **Then** system displays a message indicating no custom rules are configured and shows default Windows Search behavior
4. **Given** a standard user runs the view command, **When** the system executes, **Then** rules are displayed without requiring administrative privileges or elevation
5. **Given** user views index rules, **When** rules include file extension configurations, **Then** system displays indexing depth for each extension (Properties only or Properties and Contents)

---

### User Story 2 - Add New Index Rules (Priority: P2)

System administrators need to add new folders or file type patterns to the Windows Search index so that specific content becomes searchable through Windows Search.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary modification capability that enables users to expand search coverage to meet organizational needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a specific folder path or file pattern, verifying it's added to the index configuration, and confirming Windows Search begins indexing that location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user specifies a valid folder path, **When** user executes an "add" command with that path, **Then** system adds the folder to the Windows Search index recursively (including all subfolders) and confirms the addition
2. **Given** user specifies file type patterns (e.g., *.log, *.config), **When** user adds these patterns to a folder rule, **Then** system configures Windows Search to index only those file types in that location
3. **Given** user specifies exclusion patterns for subfolders (e.g., node_modules, .git), **When** user adds these patterns to a folder rule, **Then** system configures Windows Search to skip indexing those subfolders while indexing the rest of the folder hierarchy
4. **Given** user specifies a folder with non-recursive flag, **When** user executes the add command, **Then** system indexes only the specified folder without including subfolders
5. **Given** user attempts to add an already-indexed location, **When** the add command is executed, **Then** system displays a warning and asks for confirmation to modify existing rule
6. **Given** user specifies an invalid or non-existent path, **When** add command is executed, **Then** system displays an error message and does not modify the index configuration

---

### User Story 3 - Remove Index Rules (Priority: P3)

System administrators need to remove folders or file types from the Windows Search index to prevent sensitive data from being searchable or to optimize index size and performance.

**Why this priority**: This provides the complementary modification capability to adding rules, important for security and performance management but less critical than viewing and adding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by removing an indexed location, verifying it's removed from configuration, and confirming Windows Search stops indexing that location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a folder is currently indexed, **When** user executes a "remove" command with that folder path, **Then** system removes the folder from Windows Search index and confirms removal
2. **Given** user specifies a location to remove, **When** remove command is executed, **Then** system prompts for confirmation before proceeding with removal
3. **Given** user attempts to remove a non-indexed location, **When** remove command is executed, **Then** system displays a message indicating the location is not currently indexed
4. **Given** removal is confirmed, **When** system processes the removal, **Then** system reports whether Windows Search must rebuild its index or if the change is immediate

---

### User Story 4 - Modify Existing Index Rules (Priority: P4)

System administrators need to update existing index rules to change file type filters, inclusion/exclusion status, or other rule properties without removing and re-adding rules.

**Why this priority**: This is a convenience feature that streamlines rule management but can be accomplished through remove and add operations if needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by modifying an existing rule's properties and verifying the changes are reflected in Windows Search behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing index rule, **When** user modifies the file type filter, **Then** system updates the rule and Windows Search applies the new filter
2. **Given** an indexed folder, **When** user changes it from included to excluded (or vice versa), **Then** system updates the rule type and Windows Search responds accordingly
3. **Given** user attempts to modify a non-existent rule, **When** modify command is executed, **Then** system displays an error and suggests using the add command instead

---

### User Story 5 - Configure File Extension Indexing Depth (Priority: P5)

System administrators need to search for file extensions using wildcards and configure whether Windows Search indexes only file properties or both properties and contents for specific file types.

**Why this priority**: This enables fine-grained control over indexing behavior for specific file types, balancing search functionality with index size and performance. Less critical than basic CRUD operations but valuable for optimization.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by searching for file extensions, viewing their current indexing settings, and modifying the indexing depth for specific extensions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user wants to find all configured file extensions, **When** user executes a search command with wildcard pattern (e.g., *.*, *.log, *.*x), **Then** system displays all matching file extensions with their current indexing depth settings (Properties only or Properties and Contents)
2. **Given** user identifies a file extension, **When** user configures it to index Properties only, **Then** Windows Search indexes only file metadata (name, size, dates) without reading file contents
3. **Given** user identifies a file extension, **When** user configures it to index Properties and Contents, **Then** Windows Search indexes both metadata and full text content of files with that extension
4. **Given** user searches for file extensions, **When** no extensions match the wildcard pattern, **Then** system displays a message indicating no matching extensions found
5. **Given** user modifies indexing depth for an extension, **When** change is applied, **Then** system reports whether Windows Search must rebuild its index for affected files

---

### User Story 6 - Batch Rule Operations (Priority: P6)

System administrators need to apply multiple index rule changes from a configuration file to efficiently manage search settings across multiple systems or perform bulk operations.

**Why this priority**: This is an advanced feature for enterprise scenarios and automation, valuable but not essential for basic functionality. Lower priority than indexing depth configuration which has more immediate performance impact.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a configuration file with multiple rules and verifying all rules are applied correctly in sequence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid configuration file with multiple rules, **When** user executes a batch import command, **Then** system processes all rules and reports success/failure for each
2. **Given** user wants to export current rules, **When** user executes an export command, **Then** system generates a configuration file containing all current index rules in a portable format
3. **Given** a configuration file with some invalid rules, **When** batch import is executed, **Then** system processes valid rules and reports errors for invalid ones without stopping the entire operation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Windows Search service is stopped or disabled while executing commands?
- How does the system handle paths with special characters, spaces, or Unicode characters?
- What occurs when attempting to index a network location that becomes unavailable?
- How does the system handle permission issues when accessing restricted folders or registry keys?
- What happens when index rules conflict (e.g., parent folder excluded but child folder included)?
- How does the system behave when the Windows Search index is corrupted or in an inconsistent state?
- What occurs when disk space is insufficient for indexing operations?
- How does the system handle very long path names (exceeding MAX_PATH limitations)?
- What happens when multiple instances of the application run simultaneously?
- What occurs when a standard user attempts a modification operation without administrative privileges?
- How does the system handle conflicting filter patterns (e.g., include *.log but exclude specific.log, or exclude subfolder but include files within it)?
- What happens when user changes indexing depth for a file extension that affects millions of files (performance impact)?
- How does the system handle file extensions with multiple dots (e.g., .tar.gz, .config.json)?

### Key Entities

- **Index Rule**: Represents a configuration entry that specifies whether a location should be indexed by Windows Search; includes properties like path, rule type (include/exclude), file type filters, recursive flag, and creation timestamp
- **File Type Filter**: Defines which file extensions, specific files, or subfolders should be included or excluded within an index rule; supports wildcard patterns for flexible matching and includes indexing depth settings (Properties only vs Properties and Contents)
- **Index Location**: A folder path (local or network) that is subject to indexing rules; may have parent-child relationships with other locations
- **Configuration File**: A portable JSON representation of multiple index rules that can be exported/imported; contains all rule properties in a structured format for batch operations
- **File Extension Indexing Setting**: Represents the indexing depth configuration for a specific file extension; properties include extension pattern, indexing depth (Properties only or Properties and Contents), and modification timestamp

## Assumptions

- Windows Search service is installed and available on target systems (standard on Windows 10/11 and Windows Server)
- Standard users can run read-only operations (view, export) without elevation; administrative privileges are required only for modification operations (add, remove, modify, import)
- Windows Search uses registry and/or WMI/COM interfaces that are accessible programmatically
- Configuration file format is JSON for import/export operations
- Audit logs are written to text files in the application directory or user profile folder
- Network paths follow standard UNC naming conventions
- File type patterns use standard DOS/Windows wildcard syntax (*, ?)
- Folders are indexed recursively by default, matching typical Windows Search behavior
- File extensions have default indexing depth settings determined by Windows Search (typically Properties and Contents for known text formats, Properties only for unknown or binary formats)
- Index rebuild operations are handled by Windows Search service itself, not by this application
- The application targets modern Windows versions (Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2016+)
- Users understand basic command-line interface concepts and Windows file system structure

## Dependencies

- Windows Search service must be installed and accessible on the target system
- Administrative privileges required for modifying search index configuration
- Access to Windows Search configuration storage (registry, WMI, or COM interfaces)
- Standard Windows file system APIs for path validation and file operations

## Security Considerations

- Application must verify administrative privileges before allowing modification operations
- Sensitive paths (system directories, user private folders) should be clearly marked when displayed
- Configuration file imports should be validated to prevent injection of malicious paths
- Audit logging should capture user identity, timestamp, and action performed for compliance
- Application should not expose credentials or sensitive system information in error messages or logs

## Out of Scope

- Graphical user interface (GUI) - this is explicitly a console application
- Direct manipulation of Windows Search index database files
- Scheduling or automation of indexing operations (use Windows Task Scheduler instead)
- Performance tuning of Windows Search service itself
- Repair or troubleshooting of corrupted Windows Search indexes
- Search query functionality (viewing search results)
- Modification of Windows Search service configuration beyond index rules (e.g., service startup type, resource limits)
- Support for non-Windows operating systems
- Remote management of search indexes on other machines
- Integration with third-party search services or indexing engines
