---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Modify Existing Index Rules (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Enable administrators to update existing index rule properties without removing and re-adding rules

**Independent Test**: Run modify command as administrator on an existing rule. Change properties like recursive flag, file type filters, or rule type. Verify changes are reflected in Windows Search configuration using the list command.

### Implementation for User Story 4

**Goal**: Enable users to export current rules to JSON and administrators to import rules from JSON for bulk operations and cross-system configuration

**Independent Test**: Run export command to create a JSON file with current configuration. Verify JSON matches schema. Run import command on another machine or after clearing rules and verify all rules are restored correctly. Test merge mode and continue-on-error options.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T014) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T015-T041)
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete (T042-T091)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but builds on viewing capability
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but complements add functionality  
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent modification capability
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent extension management
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent batch operations capability

### Within Each User Story

- US1: Tasks T042-T043 can run in parallel, T044 depends on them, T045-T048 are sequential refinements
- US2: Tasks T049-T050 foundation, T051-T056 build on them sequentially
- US3: Tasks T057-T058 foundation, T059-T063 build on them sequentially
- US4: Tasks T064-T065 foundation, T066-T070 build on them sequentially
- US5: Tasks T071-T072 can run in parallel, T073-T074 foundation, T075-T079 build sequentially
- US6: Tasks T080-T081 can run in parallel, T082-T083 foundation, T084-T091 build sequentially

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: Tasks T003, T004, T005, T007-T012, T013, T014 can all run in parallel after T001-T002
- **Foundational Phase**: All enum/model creation tasks T015-T027 can run in parallel, interfaces T028-T031 can run in parallel, services/infrastructure T032-T040 can run in parallel after models/interfaces complete
- **User Stories**: Once Foundational complete, all 6 user stories can be developed in parallel by different team members
- **Within US1**: T046, T047, T048 (formatting) can run in parallel after T044
- **Within US5**: T071, T072 (commands) can run in parallel
- **Within US6**: T080, T081 (commands) can run in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: Most tasks T092-T100 can run in parallel

## Notes

- All tasks follow strict checkbox format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Tasks organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Each user story can be validated independently before moving to next priority
- Foundational phase MUST complete before any user story work begins
- No test tasks included as tests were not explicitly requested in feature specification
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Constitution compliance: All principles followed (automated testing via contract, error handling, user control, clear interfaces, documentation, incremental implementation)
