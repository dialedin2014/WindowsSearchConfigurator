- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Validation Details**:

- 12 functional requirements are concrete and testable
- 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Dependencies, assumptions, and scope boundaries are clearly documented
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are unambiguous
