# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Model Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (developers are stakeholders for test features)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED  
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-23

All checklist items passed on first iteration after initial corrections:
- Removed specific technology references (xUnit, .NET 8.0, Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Made success criteria technology-agnostic (removed test naming patterns, specific coverage tool names)
- Generalized assumptions and dependencies
- Maintained clear, measurable outcomes

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
