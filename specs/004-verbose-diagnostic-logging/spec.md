# Feature Specification: Verbose Diagnostic Logging

**Feature Branch**: `004-verbose-diagnostic-logging`  
**Created**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to be able to specify verbose tracing and have rich diagnostic info written to a file in the exe's directory."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enable Verbose Logging for Troubleshooting (Priority: P1)

A system administrator runs the WindowsSearchConfigurator tool with a verbose flag to diagnose why a specific file extension isn't being indexed properly. The tool writes detailed diagnostic information to a log file in the same directory as the executable, including registry reads/writes, COM API calls, and decision logic.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to troubleshoot issues independently, reducing support burden and improving user confidence in the tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running any command with the verbose flag and verifying that a diagnostic log file is created with detailed trace information and delivers immediate troubleshooting capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the tool is executed with a verbose flag, **When** any operation is performed, **Then** a diagnostic log file is created in the executable's directory
2. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** the tool performs registry operations, **Then** all registry reads and writes are logged with full path and value details
3. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** the tool encounters an error, **Then** the full error context including stack trace is written to the log file
4. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** the tool completes successfully, **Then** the log file contains timestamp, operation summary, and execution duration

### User Story 2 - View Diagnostic History (Priority: P2)

A system administrator needs to review what happened during a previous tool execution. They can locate and open the diagnostic log file in the executable's directory to see the complete trace of operations from earlier runs.

**Why this priority**: Provides historical context for troubleshooting recurring issues and audit trail for configuration changes.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the tool multiple times with verbose logging and verifying that log files persist and can be opened with any text editor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** verbose logging has been used previously, **When** a user navigates to the executable's directory, **Then** diagnostic log files from previous runs are available
2. **Given** multiple verbose logging sessions, **When** a user opens a log file, **Then** the log clearly identifies the session date, time, and command executed
3. **Given** a log file exists, **When** the tool runs again with verbose logging, **Then** a new log file is created without overwriting previous logs

---

### User Story 3 - Control Logging Detail Level (Priority: P3)

A user running automated scripts wants basic logging without overwhelming the log files. They can run the tool without the verbose flag to get standard output, or enable verbose mode only when detailed diagnostics are needed.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to balance between performance/file size and diagnostic detail based on their needs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the same command with and without verbose flag and comparing log output volume and detail.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the tool is executed without a verbose flag, **When** operations are performed, **Then** no diagnostic log file is created or only minimal logging occurs
2. **Given** verbose logging is enabled, **When** operations complete normally, **Then** the log includes detailed informational messages beyond just errors
3. **Given** verbose logging is disabled, **When** an error occurs, **Then** error information is still displayed to the console but without detailed trace

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the executable's directory is read-only or lacks write permissions?
- How does the system handle disk space exhaustion when writing log files?
- What happens if log files grow to extremely large sizes during long-running operations?
- How does the system handle concurrent executions of the tool with verbose logging enabled?
- What happens if the log file is locked by another process (antivirus, backup software)?
- How are sensitive data (if any) handled in log files to prevent information disclosure?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a command-line flag to enable verbose diagnostic logging
- **FR-002**: System MUST write diagnostic log files to the same directory as the executable
- **FR-003**: System MUST include timestamps for each log entry with millisecond precision
- **FR-004**: System MUST log all registry read and write operations including key paths and values
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all COM API interactions including method calls and return values
- **FR-006**: System MUST log all errors with full exception details including stack traces
- **FR-007**: System MUST create unique log file names to prevent overwriting previous logs
- **FR-008**: System MUST include the command-line arguments that triggered the logging session
- **FR-009**: System MUST log operation start time, end time, and total duration
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle write failures gracefully without crashing the tool
- **FR-011**: System MUST format log entries in a human-readable text format
- **FR-012**: System MUST log Windows Search service status checks and results
- **FR-013**: System MUST log privilege/permission check results
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide a clear log entry indicating successful completion or failure
- **FR-015**: Log file names MUST include timestamp to ensure uniqueness across multiple runs

### Key Entities

- **Diagnostic Log Entry**: Represents a single logged event with timestamp, severity level, component/source, and message text
- **Log Session**: Represents a complete execution of the tool with verbose logging, containing metadata (start time, command, user, exit code) and collection of log entries
- **Log File**: Physical file containing one or more log sessions, with naming convention based on timestamp and persistence in executable directory

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can enable verbose logging with a single command-line flag
- **SC-002**: Log files contain sufficient detail for 90% of troubleshooting scenarios without requiring debugger attachment
- **SC-003**: Log file creation completes in under 100 milliseconds additional overhead for typical operations
- **SC-004**: Users can locate and read log files within 10 seconds of tool completion
- **SC-005**: Log entries are readable and understandable by system administrators without source code access
- **SC-006**: Support inquiries requiring verbose logs decrease by 60% due to improved self-service diagnostics

## Dependencies & Assumptions *(optional)*

### Assumptions

- Users running the tool have read/write permissions in the executable's directory
- The executable's directory has sufficient disk space for log files (assuming reasonable limits like 100MB per session)
- Users understand basic command-line flags and file system navigation
- Log files use UTF-8 encoding for broad compatibility
- System clocks are reasonably synchronized for timestamp correlation
- Standard text editors can open and view the log files

### External Dependencies

- File system access APIs provided by the operating system
- System clock for timestamp generation
- No external logging frameworks required (can use built-in capabilities)

## Security & Privacy Considerations *(optional)*

### Security Concerns

- Log files may contain sensitive registry paths and values that should not be shared publicly
- Ensure log files inherit appropriate file system permissions from the executable directory
- Consider sanitizing or warning about sensitive data in log files
- Log files should not contain user credentials or authentication tokens

### Recommended Safeguards

- Document that log files may contain system configuration details and should be reviewed before sharing
- Use file system ACLs to restrict log file access to administrators
- Provide guidance on log file retention and secure deletion

## Out of Scope *(optional)*

The following are explicitly excluded from this feature:

- Remote logging or centralized log collection
- Log rotation or automatic cleanup policies
- Structured logging formats (JSON, XML) - text format is sufficient
- Real-time log streaming or monitoring
- Log encryption or compression
- Performance profiling or metrics beyond operation duration
- Integration with Windows Event Log
- Log file size limits or quotas
- Configurable log file location beyond the executable directory
