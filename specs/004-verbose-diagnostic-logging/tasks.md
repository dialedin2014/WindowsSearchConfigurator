**Checkpoint**: At this point, file logging infrastructure is complete and tested ‚úÖ

---

## Phase 4: User Story 1 Integration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Wire up file logging to Program.cs and existing commands so verbose flag actually creates log files

**Independent Test**: Execute `WindowsSearchConfigurator.exe list --verbose` and verify log file created with valid format

### Implementation for User Story 1 Integration (Batch 2)

- [ ] T022 [US1] Update dependency injection in Program.cs to register IFileLogger, ILogFileNameGenerator, and VerboseLogger

## Phase 6: User Story 2 - View Diagnostic History (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to locate and review diagnostic log files from previous tool executions for troubleshooting recurring issues

**Independent Test**: Run the tool multiple times with verbose logging, then verify that multiple log files exist in the executable directory with unique names and can be opened with any text editor

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T036 [P] [US2] Add integration test for multiple verbose sessions creating unique log files in tests/WindowsSearchConfigurator.IntegrationTests/MultipleSessionsIntegrationTests.cs

- [ ] T040 [US2] Create example log file documentation showing typical troubleshooting scenarios in docs/LogFileExamples.md

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - users can create logs and review them later

---

## Phase 7: User Story 3 - Control Logging Detail Level (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Allow users to control when verbose logging occurs, running without the flag for normal operation and enabling verbose mode only when detailed diagnostics are needed

**Independent Test**: Run the same command with and without the `--verbose` flag and verify that no log file is created without the flag, and minimal overhead occurs

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T041 [P] [US3] Add integration test verifying no log file created without verbose flag in tests/WindowsSearchConfigurator.IntegrationTests/NoVerboseModeIntegrationTests.cs

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately ‚úÖ
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phases 3-5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚úÖ (review only)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - models and interfaces)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Infrastructure (file logging core)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 - Integration (wire to Program.cs)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 1 - Completion (comprehensive logging + tests)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready - **MVP COMPLETE** üéØ

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Phases 3-5) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Log history review)
4. Add User Story 3 (Phase 7) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Logging control)
5. Polish (Phase 8) ‚Üí Final release
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Batch Strategy (Avoid Context Window Overflow)

**User Story 1 is split into 3 batches**:
- **Batch 1 (Phase 3)**: 8 files - Core infrastructure (models, interfaces, FileLogger, LogFileNameGenerator, tests)
- **Batch 2 (Phase 4)**: 6 files - Integration (Program.cs, 3 commands)
- **Batch 3 (Phase 5)**: 9 files - Completion (remaining commands, services, integration/contract tests)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (Phase 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Phases 3-5) - Core feature
   - Wait for Developer A to complete Phase 5
3. After US1 complete:
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Phase 6) - Documentation/testing
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Phase 7) - Performance/control
   - Developer A: Polish (Phase 8) - Edge cases
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Format Validation ‚úÖ

All tasks follow the required checklist format:
- ‚úÖ Checkbox: `- [ ]` at start
- ‚úÖ Task ID: Sequential (T001-T056)
- ‚úÖ [P] marker: Only on parallelizable tasks
- ‚úÖ [Story] label: Only on user story phases (US1, US2, US3)
- ‚úÖ Description: Clear action with exact file path
- ‚úÖ Setup/Foundational: No story labels
- ‚úÖ User Story phases: All have story labels
- ‚úÖ Polish phase: No story labels

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within the batch
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- User Story 1 is split into 3 batches (4-6 files each) to avoid AI context window overflow
- User Story 2 depends on User Story 1 (need logs to review)
- User Story 3 depends on User Story 1 (need logging to control)
- All file paths are absolute within the WindowsSearchConfigurator project structure
- Constitution principles validated: All gates pass ‚úÖ
